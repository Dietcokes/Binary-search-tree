# Binary-search-tree

You are required to write a program in C programming language that has a function named
bst construct). This function receives two arrays from main) function storing in-order and
post-order traversal outputs shown below. The function then construct a binary search tree
(bst) using the in-order and post-order traversal outputs passed to it by main(0 function. The
bst_construct() function then retuns address to the root node back to he main() function,
the caller function Using the address of the root node returmed, the main) function traverse
the created binary search tree (bst) in breadth-first-search (DFS) traversal while printing each
element on standard output device, ie. computer sereen.
Post-order: 5, 15, 10,25, 45, 30,20
In-order. 5, 10, 15, 20,25, 30,45
